### Clothing/shoe resell website

This website is for reselling clothings, shoes, etc similar to stockX website but it can be used for any type of website that involves selling multiple products. Using strapi and their relations tool, I've made a date base so that you can add multiple items and news/articles to different categories easily. For example, products have different categories and items you add manually goes into the category you choose. Newsroom also has categories for different type of news. As single types, I've added privacy rights and terms of service since you would be updating the content instead of adding content. You can also add your own categories and content type if you need more content types. For components, I made a button and view counter for the articles. I've provided a potential sitemap but that can also be changed easily depending on what the client wants.
